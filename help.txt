2 folders, one with cmd to change icon and the folder with icons, have the icons duplicate to another folder that acts as front

Structure:


Iconchanger script kept in random folder


2 services:

1. powershell cmd to keep 2nd alive | Drops Iconchanger script into random system folder
2. Checks to see if;



A. Script is in Task Sceduler and Startup folder, if they arn't gets copied from random place from service A, does this by searching all system folder with specific name
B. Copies photos no matter what into photos folder where iconchanger pulls from, have photos in hidden specific system folder, named 


Iconchanger = regnahcnocI



Task scheduler:

runs iconchanger script

Startup folder:

runs iconchanger script














Get-Service -Name T* ---------------------------------------------finds service
sc.exe delete "YourServiceName" --------------------------- Deletes service



Task scheduler runs bat file that copies nssm exe and sub files from randomly placed place, searches for the folder and then copies it















Whole Idea:

Powershell that changes icons on taskbar

needs to run atleast once every reboot of computer 

NSSM manager runs service that will check startup folder and easy to find task scheduler powershell icon changer script and reinput them in



think about adding service that runs powershell script to
check to see if disableing it in msconfig actualy stops it
have task scheduler have more hidden task that copies nssm exe if deleted



Service is main host:

Main service is named to ofuscate and makes multiple services that purposly look fake

Main service checks task scheduler and startup folder and reinputs if they are deleted



Insert stuff in this folder C:\Windows\IME\IMEJP\Assets

hide icons seperatly from scripts




for another sabotage, add another hard drive and have admin give it power so it can run what ever it wants

phonetic alphabet as Task schedule name (Have Fun) (Hotel Alpha Victor Echo Foxtrot Uniform November)
